## What is Memory Jar?
Memory Jar is a simple mindfulness/recreational application that allows users to write down and recall memories. With how fast paced the world is moving, it is important that people take a step back and remember where they came from. Additionally, there are features that allow you to continue dreaming by jotting down memories you'd like to create. Simply jot down some thoughts into this program and simply revisit and reminisce.

### Getting Started
Begin by cloning this repo onto your local device. <br>
- ```git clone https://github.com/atu816/Memory_Jar.git``` <br>

Run the application with the following command.
- ```npm run dev```

Open the application in a local browser at ```http://localhost:8080/```.

### How to Use It

Creating a memory:
1. Select 'Past' or 'Future'.
2. If 'Past', input a memory name and the date it occurred.
3. If 'Future', input just the memory name.
4. Hit submit.
Your memory is now stored.

Recalling a memory:
1. Select either memories to remember or create.
2. Memories will be displayed at random.
3. (optl) Delete memories you no longer want to see.


## Future Additions
Below are some features to come. 
- Add user integration.
- View all memories option.
- Implement algorithm to guide which memories are presented.
- Create edit options on stored memories.
